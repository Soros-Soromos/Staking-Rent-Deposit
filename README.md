# Staking Rent Deposit

Hi, I'm Stefan LÃ¶ffler. Thank you for checking out my contract.
This is just the prototype, which will be developed further in the following weeks.

The Idea: When renting an apartment or a house, renters are in most countries required to pay a security deposit from about 1 to 3 months of rent. As for in recent times, with 0% interest rates and renting duration of over 10 years, much money is left on the table. So I made a contract where the renter could deposit Eth and later withdraw it (my first idea was to stake UST, but that's history now...)

The Missing Parts:
- Automatic Staking of the Deposit
- A function for the landlord to release the Deposit
- Proper Testing, Documentation, and Error handling
- Contract Verification
- Gas Optimization
- Modern UI
- etc.

Your Feedback: Always welcome :)
